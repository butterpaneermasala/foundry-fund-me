# FundMe Solidity Project

## Overview

The **FundMe** project is a decentralized application (dApp) that allows users to fund a smart contract with Ethereum. The contract owner can withdraw the funds accumulated in the contract. This project is built using **Solidity** for the smart contract and **Foundry** for development and testing.

## Features

- Users can send Ether to the smart contract.
- The contract tracks the contributors and their contributions.
- Only the owner of the contract can withdraw the funds.
- Gas-efficient implementation using best practices.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following tools installed:

- **Foundry**: Install Foundry by following the instructions on the [Foundry Book](https://book.getfoundry.sh/).
- **Node.js and npm**: Required for managing dependencies if you plan to integrate with a frontend.
- **Metamask** or any other Ethereum wallet for interaction.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/fundme.git
cd fundme
